# RoBoxLEDs

Arduino Control of a strip of AdaFruit NeoPixel LED's mounted in a Robot Cart

As described in the opening comments, this code should probably be a fork of the Safety Glasses Traffic light system
in the Forge, but creating a fork is above my skill set at this point. This Code is designed to run on an Arduino
mounted to the top of a robot cart I designed and built for FTC team 6078 - Cut The Red Wire. As with all of my projects
and most Forge projects, it was completed at the last minute, probably as the cars were being loaded for competition.

I really do want CTRW students to modify the code, and even the hardware, to make it your own. Improve it so there is
less bailing wire and duct tape in the code, and help me learn to write better code. Make the code easy to read, so
people who are just getting started with code can understand what is going on. It's a place where a student who 
isn't sure they can code can play with code that contributes to the team but not have to fear the big scary code
that runs on the robot.

All I ask is that you maintain the code on GitHub so it might help another student or team to learn some cool stuff.

First commit, Feb 2022 but the code was forked/written in 2017.

Apparently, its good form to include a link to required Libraries - This makes sense, as I often have problems
  with code that I get from GitHub not having all the libraries, and then I spin my wheels looking for them.
  So - This code requires the AdaFruit Neopixel Library which resides in Git at:
